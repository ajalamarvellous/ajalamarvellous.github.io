## About
------------
DL Frame work is an educational based library which implements core deep learning concepts using just numpy.

The framework is designed not as a replacement for major deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow or Keras but rather as an educational content to see the implementation of deep learning concepts and designed with APIs similar to keras

> This project is still ongoing active development and contributions are welcome

Currently, implemented:
[x] Feed forward propagation
[x] Back propagation
[x] Convolution layer
[] RNN layer
[] GNN layer
[] Transformer block
[x] Activation layer - ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
[x] Training interface
[x] Dropout layer
[x] Early stoppage
[x] Gradient Descent
