I am a Machine learning engineer, a pharmacist and a researcher based in Nigeria.
I recently graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Pharmacy from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I currently work as an intern pharmacist at Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso. Previously, I worked at [Juicelife (previously Meuve Health)](https://juicelife.io) and [Lifebox Labs](https://lifebox.ng) 

My primary research interest lies in application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery specifically in virtual screening and de novo drug design. However, I'm involved in efforts generally geared towards global health, public health and application of AI in healthcare also.

In my spare time, you'll catch me writing. So I maintain a number of blogs on [Medium](https://madeofajala.medium.com), [Hashnode](https://madeofajala.hashnode.dev) and [Substack](https://the-continum.substack.com). I'm also a nature lover and I run a beautiful photography page of [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shotsbymarve) while pausing on my DJ and chef career.

If you're interested in checking out my research, you can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/marvellousajala) or if you're a recruiter, you can check out my CV [here](assets/pdf/CV-Marvellous-Ajala.pdf)
