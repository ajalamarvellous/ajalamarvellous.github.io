I am a <a href='#'><i>Machine learning engineer</i></a> , a <a href='#'><i>pharmacist</i></a> and a <a href='#'><i>researcher</i></a> based in Nigeria.

I recently graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Pharmacy from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I currently work as an intern pharmacist at Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso. Previously, I worked at [Juicelife (previously Meuve Health)](https://www.juicelife.io), a Lagos-based AI startup using AI and computer vision to remotely track, evaluate and quantify workouts (exercises), Recop.it (<i>now defunct</i>), a social commerce platform and [Dryad Network](https://www.dryad.net) (collaboration with Omdena), a climatetech startup using AI and sensors to track wildfires in the Amazon. I've also worked with [Lifebox Labs](https://lifebox.ng), a lifesciences startup building digital therapeutics for hypertensive and diabetic patients in Lagos. 

My primary research interest lies in application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery specifically in virtual screening and de novo drug design. However, I'm involved in efforts generally geared towards global health, public health and application of AI in healthcare also. I was part of the organising committee for the [Data Science for Health](https://ro-ya-cv4africa.github.io/homepage/event_workshop.html) workshop at the just concluded Deep Learning Indaba, 2024.

In my spare time, you'll catch me writing. So I maintain a number of blogs on [Medium](https://madeofajala.medium.com), [Hashnode](https://madeofajala.hashnode.dev) and [Substack](https://the-continum.substack.com), I'm creating a centralised mailimg list to disseminate my essays, if you'll love to subscribe to the mailing list, please do so [here](blog/2024/mailing-list). I'm also a nature lover and I run a beautiful photography page of [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shotsbymarve).

If you're interested in checking out my research, you can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=67T6um4AAAAJ&hl=en) or if you're a recruiter, you can check out my CV [here](assets/pdf/CV-Marvellous-Ajala.pdf).

> I'm currently looking for a new role though, so incase you're a hiring manager and just looking to hire one for your team or company, my expertise spans visualizations, building machine learning models, deploying and  maintaining models in production and monitoring (MLOPs), CV, LLMs and ML research, so I'll love to connect with you [email](mailto:ajalaoluwamayowa00@gmail.com).
