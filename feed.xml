In case you missed it, in my previous article, I wrote about the ‚ÄúLessons from failure‚Äù which you can read <a href="https://www.ajalamarvellous.xyz/blog/2025/lessons-from-failure/">here</a>. However, today I want to talk about something else, a particular form of thinking that I believe is commonplace but I do not believe it is true, and it is the idea that ‚Äúif we do not get something we really desired (or failed at it), then we probably didn‚Äôt put in our very best‚Äù.</p>

    "Sometimes, we do everything right and still lose‚Äù
</div>

<p>I first came across this quote some 3/4 years ago and it just stuck to my mind, maybe because of my personal experiences, maybe because it sounds antithetical to present common knowledge or saying that says if you didn‚Äôt get something you really wanted, it‚Äôs probably because you didn‚Äôt try enough or that wasn‚Äôt your ‚Äúpossibly best‚Äù self, and maybe that is true, maybe it isn‚Äôt actually your possibly best self, but the way the saying is used connotes that the  ‚Äúpossibly best‚Äù version of you was accessible at that point in time which for some reason you just didn‚Äôt leverage, and that my friend, is where I disagree.</p>

<p>In this essay, I‚Äôll try to explain why ‚Äúwe still lose sometimes after doing everything right‚Äù with 3 points and I will also attempt to explain this from 2 different point of view: community-wise and individual-wise.</p>

<p><strong>Community-wise</strong>: To understand why it is possible to do your possible best and still fail is to understand that, while maybe your overall competition in life is between the current version of you and the theoretical best version of you, it is also important to note that any fellowship, competition, graduate admission etc you will be making, is you competing with other people for that limited possible spots, which brings me to the first reason: <strong>hypercompetition.</strong> Apart from a very limited number of roles and opportunities where you are super early in the industry and the world does not know about or you fall into a category of some selectively protected roles and opportunities reserved for people and your affinity group, for most other opportunities, we are currently experiencing a form of hypercompetition, where for every limited opportunity, there is a large number of very qualified people all jostling for these limited opportunities with you and this is happening for 2 reasons: access to information and globalization.</p>

<p>With the growth of the internet and the rise of digital content creation, we have seen more people who previously were cut out from certain information needed for them to compete on a global scale for some kind of opportunities have access to these information, and with this access, you have more people becoming aware of not only the existence of these opportunities but also the requirements, profiles of previous winners etc and now more people putting in the work needed for them to also compete. The other reason is that with increased globalization, countries are now beginning to fight fiercely to attract the best talents possible, especially from regions which have a lot of talents but limited opportunities. This means pool for some of these opportunities have drastically increased in size leaving more people jostling for the same limited opportunities.</p>

<p>The impact of this is that, it is now impossible for companies, schools, etc, to fairly evaluate all applications they receive and/or to give everyone truly deserving an opportunity the fair chance. So what does this mean? Because the pool of evenly qualified candidates is far greater than what most organizations can fairly access or take in, many talented people, truly deserving of the opportunity are denied such opportunities and friends, that sucks.</p>

<p>However, beyond the community-wise hypercompetition, some individual-based factors also need to be considered. First is the individuality of each person‚Äôs life path and how the uniqueness of their life‚Äôs journey contribute to their personhood, and because of the sequential nature of life, there are some future experiences and encounters that contributes to your personal hypothetical best-version (this I define as the overall best version of you in your entire lifetime). So at the time of your making your application, there are some unique experiences, knowledge and interactions that your future self will have that could improve your chances getting the opportunity but which you currently do not have nor have access to. These experiences do not even refer to costly mistakes and whatnot, but sometimes mundane or random interactions, occurrences and things you probably have no control over. To put this into perspective, there are some roles you will apply for and you will be disqualified just based on the geographical information of where you are, coming from or born, that your future self that is naturalized or a permanent resident of that country will be accepted for with no other difference beyond that. But the point is, it doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt put in your very best, the honest possible best you could at that point in time to have guaranteed yourself a better odd. When this is then combined with the hypercompetition earlier mentioned, it is easy to see why this is the case.</p>

<p>The other and final reason why I belief that it is possible to put your absolute best in something and still lose, also from the individual point of view, is that the opposite, suggests that we are supposed to win everything we put our absolute best in. This point of view is wrong simply because that is just not how life works. It does not matter who you are, who you parents are, where you are coming from, you just simply cannot have a 100% win ratio of every opportunity you apply for (except they were all carefully handed over to you, in which case, has been excluded from the point of this essay). Life just doesn‚Äôt work that way, failure is just an integral part of life as much as success is and we are all bound to experience both, no matter how good or exceptional we believe ourselves to be, we all experience the same thing and that is what makes life, life.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while all these are logical explanations of why sometimes we fail after putting in our best, the summary is failure is never fun, it is never enjoyable and I‚Äôm also not an agent of doom, so just like the Bible puts it <em>‚Äútears can last all night, but joy comes in the morning‚Äù.</em> Life might be hitting you hard on all sides and you feel life has just someway somehow conspired against you, my ultimate belief is this, ‚Äúlife is not unfair‚Äù, so it might seem like it is against you today, but give it long enough, the universe will conspire for your good too soon, you just need to stay alive and keep pushing, keep trying your best, because ‚Äúit is who is dead, that has no hope anymore‚Äù and ‚Äúeven the wrong clock is right at least twice a day‚Äù.</p>

    Original tweet by @madeofajala on twitter, dated:Dec 31, 2023, "I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.‚Äù
</div>

<p>Sometime in 2023, I shared a quote on X (previously Twitter). Here‚Äôs the interesting thing: it‚Äôs a quote from a book I have never read. But, like the quote itself suggests, it isn‚Äôt one that is supposed to be quoted from a book or whipped up on an inspirational basis, it is one that is best experienced.</p>

<p>The thing is, failure is not an easy topic to talk about. Nobody wants to be seen as a specialist in failure, and thus no one wants to claim authority in this regard. Neither do I. I believe my experience with failure pales in comparison to many people‚Äôs, but I have experienced my fair share, and despite how difficult it is to talk about it, there are still some important lessons we can all take away from failure.</p>

<p>I believe the most important lesson we learn from failure is ‚Äúgrace‚Äù. This is something we usually don‚Äôt recognize until we have experienced it ourselves. Here‚Äôs what I mean: Most of us have a simple, reductionist view of life‚Äî‚ÄúIf you fail, it‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt read‚Äù,  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre poor, it‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre not hardworking enough‚Äù, ‚ÄúIf you miss out on an important memory, it‚Äôs because you either didn‚Äôt value it or didn‚Äôt commit it to memory enough‚Äù. On the surface, these statements appear true, or at least they seem easier to accept when flipped: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt read, you will fail‚Äù. So, when someone fails, it‚Äôs assumed they didn‚Äôt do the former.</p>

<p>When I entered university, I had this very same mindset: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you failed? You probably played away your time or didn‚Äôt value your education enough to put in the required effort‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople celebrating being graded 50 in an exam? Eww!‚Äù. It also didn‚Äôt help that I was a high flyer. For exams graded over 100, I aimed for 80s and 90s and achieved them most times. I just couldn‚Äôt fathom why people would settle for less.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the thing: most people with these beliefs genuinely believe them, because they simplify life, making it easier for them to interpret and navigate. However, the challenge with broad statements like these is that they don‚Äôt accommodate nuance‚Äîbecause nuance lives on the edge (where I have been mostly these days, pun intended). This isn‚Äôt to debunk or nullify the truth in those statements, because, truly truly (I say to you), as a student, if you don‚Äôt read or study, chances are you will probably fail, and that‚Äôs a high probability. This truth translates to many other things. However, failure teaches you that, while effort is crucial, sometimes and many times, there are many other factors can cause it and this does not include lack of effort.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until my third year in university that I truly understood this. I didn‚Äôt need to do anything extraordinary; I just had to prepare my reading schedule from the beginning of the semester and diligently read my books. But something changed. For some reason, I wasn‚Äôt getting the same results as I had before. To my simple mind, the only explanation was that I probably wasn‚Äôt putting in my best. In response, I decided to put in <strong>extraaaa</strong> effort. But here was the challenge: the more effort I put in, the more the results I greatly sought eluded me. Efforts that previously earned me 70s and 80s were now yielding 50s, 60s, and, at best, 69s that still got downgraded.</p>

<p>It was during this time that my eyes were opened to others around me who were in similar situations: putting in their best effort, trying hard and harder, some even harder than I did, but still not getting results. Some even had to retake exams. I learned compassion. I learned to give people grace, that just because something comes easily to you and not to others doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt put in as much effort. As my Bible puts it: ‚ÄúThe race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all‚Äù.</p>

<p>Sometime last year, I broke up with my ex. A couple of weeks ago, during a chat with my friendship group, they were ‚Äúwhining‚Äù me about my serious girlfriend from before (haha, if you recognize those discussions). Someone said, ‚ÄúNext time, before you make a move like that, be sure you heard God properly‚Äù and I totally understood where he was coming from because his perspective came from the truest intentions. Prior to that experience, this would have been my default response to anyone in a similar situation. However, as they say, experience is the best teacher. I‚Äôve now learned that so much happens on the edge, and life can‚Äôt always be interpreted with the simplest explanations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PS: My circle is a God-centric and believing one, as I am myself, so thoughts like these are not out of place.</p>

<p>In addition to grace, failure has taught me something else, something we really need to learn, even though it‚Äôs tough: the ability to fail even moreüòÇ. This is interesting because I started this essay by mentioning how no one likes to lose, including myself. But the interesting thing is that we need to learn how to lose, fail, and keep trying again. Last year, Roger Federer gave a commencement address at Dartmouth College (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWUuYTcG-o">link here</a>) that I found fascinating. He mentioned how he isn‚Äôt recognized as one of the greatest of all time in tennis by winning every match, game, or competition. Instead, it‚Äôs by his continued effort, time and time again. ‚ÄúFor you to be great at anything, you need to get comfortable with losing‚Äù. So, how do you fail without failing? Or how do you get comfortable with failing without failing?</p>

<p>In my personal observation, those at the top of their careers often have the lowest win ratios at the start of their journeys. You need to take so many shots in the beginning, many of which you‚Äôll miss, fail miserably at, or fall short of, but you have to learn how to fail and deal with failure while still pressing on. As I often say to my friends, ‚Äúmost people won‚Äôt care how many shots it took you to win, they‚Äôll only care that you won‚Äù.</p>

<p>Maybe what I‚Äôm trying to say in many words is this: failure teaches resilience. It teaches you to keep moving in the face of adversity, even when it seems nothing is yielding results, not to give up or give in too early. The first time you fail, it will most definitely affect you deeply, perhaps to your core. It may cause you to doubt everything you‚Äôve believed about yourself, your dignity, or even your personhood, especially if your sense of self is tied to your ability to achieve excellence. Getting comfortable with failure helps you detach from this mindset. Your sense of self and personhood is not tied to success or failure. A bad day is not a bad life. You just need to keep moving, striving, and making an effort. All you need is that one big break.</p>

<p>Now that I‚Äôve exhausted the serious lessons we can learn from failure (not an exhaustive list, just the most important ones I can muster at this point), there‚Äôs one more lesson, albeit a funny but nonetheless important one: failure gives you interesting stories to tell. Think about it, some of your personal most captivating stories most definitely came from moments of adversity. Were they funny in real time? Definitely not. But in retrospect, they often are. And unless you want to be the boring uncle or aunt who never has a funny story to tell, this is another reason to optimize for failure. üòÇ So fail more today and thank me tomorrow.</p>

<p>The summary is: not all failures are fatal and failure is never easy to deal with, no matter how many times you‚Äôve failed. Some failures will still paralyze you and hold you in a chokehold. Yes, you‚Äôll be disappointed. Yes, you‚Äôll be pained. Yes, you may need to take time off to gather yourself. But what you can never do is stop trying. Till next time, shalom! ‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæ</p>

However, I am not going to church tonight, it‚Äôs not like I ever really attend one (christmas eve service), but tonight particularly, I‚Äôm trying to enjoy the beautiful view of the night sky, maybe I could also catch a glimpse of the star leading on the wise men to Bethlehem. In the midst of this, my memory is filled with my most consistent memory of Christmas eve growing up, fetching water from the well beside the house I used to live (because the next day is Christmas and fetching water from the well does not look anything like what is fitting for a day you should be chilling and enjoying). While I do not live there again, neither can I remember specifically the last time I had to draw from a well, I just but can‚Äôt imagine and ponder on how far I have come.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Present day:</strong> 2024 was a really good year for me but not in the way you think about it. If you‚Äôve read any of my previous year in review, well, this is not like them, because sadly I did not get a job at Google, attend top conferences I would have loved to attend, razzle-dazzled you and stuff like that, nah, in comparison to those things, this year will look pale, but it was nonetheless a good.</p>

<p>From the first day of the year, you would however have known this year was going to be standing on business a lot, I mean who starts the year on a Monday and it wasn‚Äôt that I was just working that day, I was on call. In fact, they started calling me as early as 7am to remind me I had to be at work in the morning (well, a coincidence as they were trying to call my colleague). But that way, the theme of the year was alot centered on doing my compulsory 1 year internship. Well, compulsory only if you want to become a fully licensed pharmacist in Nigeria, not like I wanted to ( or didn‚Äôt want to), but it won‚Äôt hurt anyway and why don‚Äôt I.</p>

<p>I learnt a lot however during that one year, for some reason I always though I will be a terrible pharmacist, not because I really don‚Äôt care, but for the longest time, it just seemed like that one thing that has consistently been between me and what I really enjoy. So I started with the mind of let this phase just pass me by, I intentionally chose where I did it thinking I probably won‚Äôt do much work (or so I thought üò≠üò≠üò≠). Anyway, I learnt I‚Äôm a really great one at that (you can ask my patients and they‚Äôll give you testimonials), for some reason I enjoyed it and in some alternate universe, I‚Äôll choose to be settle down as one (well, sadly not this though üòÜ)</p>

<p>But year had some really down lows, like really down. Like getting rejections emails so many programs I applied for that I almost passed out, twas tough man. I also broke up with my girlfriend (you need to read the previous year-in-review to get this complete gist ü§£ ü§£ ü§£), I couldn‚Äôt attend any of the top conferences I would have wanted, didn‚Äôt publish any paper I worked on during the year and many others I can‚Äôt even remember at the moment.</p>

<p>But the year wasn‚Äôt all bleak, I finished my internship and this was a very big deal for me. Finally, it seemed I can now do whatever it is that piques my fancy (looking at NYSC with the funny side eye). I also met new people, co-organised a workshop at a top conference, worked on many interesting projects (many that I look forward to publishing this year), invited for a guest lecture at a workshop for graduate and post graduate students, made some money (I mean when the iphone 6 I‚Äôve been using for more than 2 years got tired on me and packed up, I was able just change it just like that)but most importantly, I LIVED.</p>

<p>The prologue wouldn‚Äôt make sense to you if you didn‚Äôt know how I have always lived my life till this point. The thing is I have lived all my life in eager anticipation, waiting for the time things will get better, when everything will align, when I will begin to live my dreams, the better tomorrow we have always dreamed off, and so for the longest time, I didn‚Äôt even see the life in front of me that was getting by, unnoticed, unremarkable, earnestly waiting for the next and better one, so 2024 was the year I lived, the year I lived in the moment, enjoyed the little moments, experienced joy in the mundane and just LIVED. Lived with the knowledge that this is a point of my life I will never recover anymore, with the knowledge that this is a point I won‚Äôt forever be, point I will look back at and craved once again, so why not just live?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúSeize life! Eat bread with gusto, Drink wine with a robust heart. Oh yes‚ÄîGod takes pleasure in your pleasure! Dress festively every morning. Don‚Äôt skimp on colors and scarves. Relish life with the spouse you love. Each and every day of your precarious life. Each day is God‚Äôs gift. It‚Äôs all you get in exchange For the hard work of staying alive. Make the most of each one! Whatever turns up, grab it and do it. And heartily! This is your last and only chance at it, For there‚Äôs neither work to do nor thoughts to think In the company of the dead, where you‚Äôre most certainly headed
Ecclesiastes 9:7-10 MSG</p>

<p>If there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very good at, it is delayed gratification or delayed happiness you can call it. I‚Äôm a firm believer that anything worthwhile takes time and so if you really want to be happy, you should be able to wait, to defer it till a later, as the Bible puts it, ‚Äútill your joy is full‚Äù. So at every point, something appears like my biggest op (short for opposition).</p>

<p>Initially, my biggest op was my University, for a school with a high ceiling and the potential to be a lot more, choosing to be mediocre annoyed and frustrated me. I felt handicapped, I felt hoodwinked. While my colleagues abroad are learning how to apply artificial intelligence in drug discovery and, the latest advances in clinical pharmaceutical sciences, I felt forced and coerced into cramming shikimic pathway and writing word for word some things some lecturer dictated out in class (and that‚Äôs not because I think they some of those things are not important, I just felt emphasis was on the wrong things. BTW I do not think, cramming and writing verbatim is important for anybody or anything, atleast not in 2024 again).</p>

<p>Then my biggest op became the pharmacy profession based on how it was portrayed in Nigeria. I felt I needed to do something else outside the profession for me to be truly happy. Between the constant jabs and warfare with the healthcare sector between those who think the whole health sector is under their servitude and so they run the whole sector and others, to people within the profession that will rather exploit and underpay the young ones, the crazy work schedule and work hours, commitments, etc, it just doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs a way this profession could buy me a Benz in the nearest future without running a retail/community pharmacy, which isn‚Äôt something that I‚Äôm really interested in per se, I honestly just want to do some awesome research, discover new therapies and make the world a better place (BTW, I do not attach any intrinsic value to Benz, it‚Äôs just a colloquial way of estimating wealth here in Nigeria).</p>

<p>Later on, my biggest op became Nigeria. See, Nigeria showed me in an active term what it means when they say ‚Äútalents are global, opportunities are not‚Äù. Nigeria, in a pessimist‚Äôs words, ‚Äúis the place dreams come to die‚Äù. Every day is a fight for survival, a fight for legitimacy and for your right to survive, to exist, to be and to thrive. One of the worst inflation in decades, weakening currency, high unemployment rate, rife crimerate, tribalism and national discord plus for some reason, it seems like the worst of us has managed to capture the state and state apparatus, so like you can imagine, it has been disaster upon disaster. Just like someone said on twitter, ‚Äúit reached our turn to make dough (money), na so cost of living con start to dey rise‚Äù. While I love this country to bits and would love to see it work, function and rise to her name, I just feel like I need to first be out of here to truly be happy, and if you were in my shoes, you‚Äôd reckon I was making the best choice.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of all that, I‚Äôm constantly reminded of the words of NightBirde (the Britain Got Talent star) who despite having just a few months left to live due to cancer she had, came on to show and shared one of the most powerful quotes I‚Äôve heard in a while ‚ÄúYou can not wait until life isn‚Äôt hard anymore before you decide to be happy‚Äù, and that, ladies and gentlement, struck a cord in me. The idea that happiness is a destination that needs to be reached, that it‚Äôs some achievement, some milestone that needs to be ticked, I have come to learn is all an illusion that will always be eluded, because human wants and needs are insatiable and at the point in which we achieve those things, we want some other new thing and the circle continues. The other reason is life is an equal balance and mix of good days and bad days, like the preacher says, ‚ÄòA time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace,and a time to refrain from embracing‚Äù. The summary is there‚Äôs going to be a time for all and one does not invalidate the other, however, just like the moon, we are not less human or less deserving of happiness on days we feel half-full or empty.</p>

<p>So just like the Christian Apostle, Paul, I want to say ‚ÄúI know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have in abundance. I have learnt the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want‚Äù and through it all, I have chosen to be happy. And also because I believe we can share positivity round the world by us choosing to be happy. I believe by shining our light strongly, beautifully and unashamed of our scars, we encourage and empower others to do so also, we tell them they can choose to be happy, despite the shitty coins life might be shelling on them today, they deserve to be happy and choose to be happy.</p>

<p>So today, as I celebrate another year around the star in our Milky Way galazy (birthday), I am choosing to chase happiness and to be happy regardless of the circumstance, to seek happiness in the little and mundane things, to linger a bit more on that call with that friend that I have missed, to hold and hug a bit longer the friend I haven‚Äôt seen in forever, to chat and hang out a bit more with my friends while I can now, to buy those sneakers that I have always wanted, to dance in the rain while listening to my favourite childhood jam, not because happiness is found in things or people, because in the end, all we are left with the choice to either be happy or wallow in the pits of self pity and regrets and as for me, I‚Äôll rather fill them with the little sprinkle of happiness that I can find and because that, I believe everyone deserves just to be a little bit happier and also because being happy is one of the best things I can also contribute to the world right, by sharing my joy that isn‚Äôt defined nor limited by the challenges and trials of this world but one that is evergreen and ethereal, I remind and encourage others to also.</p>

<p>Sometimes, counting our blessings is all we need to remind ourselves how far we have come, that everything is not all gloom, everything is not all bad and by all means, we are miles away from where we started, maybe not at the destination yet but we far ahead of the starting point, and ladies and gentlemen, that is progress.</p>

<p>2023 was a solid year for me, but it took me writing out this thread on Twitter sometime last week for me to come to terms with how great it was. Here is the thing, I started this year on a great note and with high expectations. Finally, I was doing my dream job as a machine learning engineer at a new but awesome startup building a very nice product. The best part of it? My role was core machine learning, machine learning engineering and ops, just enough dose of what I like and enjoy doing, life was good bruh!! I think the peak was me attending Lagos Tech Expo and seeing the excitement and awe on people‚Äôs faces using the product I‚Äôve been building, it‚Äôs like that moment when a mother finally meets the baby she has been carrying for months, the joy is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>That same quarter, a paper I contributed to was accepted at ICLR, this was yunno a huge one for my budding research career also, a big shoutout to Chris Fourie, one of the nicest people I know at SisonkeBiotik and the entire team, hoping I can do more for the community this year. I bought myself a MacBook also. So here‚Äôs the backstory to that, as of last year December, if someone told me I was going to buy myself a Macbook I will say it was a lie, the only hope I had for winning a MacBook was via two giveaways (Enyata and Cardtonic, both who were doing giveaways at the time), interestingly, I got to the final stage for both but lost both, I was like, yunno what? I‚Äôm going to buy myself a Macbook and I did. Guess I was a bit liquid at the time (the next goal is ‚Äúunbelievable liquid‚Äù, from my mouth to God‚Äôs ear).</p>

<p>I think the highlight was my interview for Meta‚Äôs AI residency program in March. This singular incident is the greatest motivation I have in my career that ‚Äúif I‚Äôve made it this far, then I can only go all the way‚Äù. I mean this was me, learning Stochastic Gradient Descent, GANs and Graph Neural Networks in the morning while cramming the shikimic pathway, Feline Diabetes and Pharmacodynamic parameters at night. Just 3 years ago, for more than 6 months, all I was able to learn was via Google Colab using my 1 gig RAM Itel phone that by the time you switch tabs, you have to wait 20 mins for the tab to load again. The most interesting part of it was that the interview was on Data Structures and Algorithms which I really didn‚Äôt have that much idea about prior and went on to kill the interview with just about 3 weeks of preparations. 
Sadly, Meta had to close the role just because of the macroeconomic challenges at the time (they had just laid off another set of people, I think). I went on to interview with some other top companies both locally and globally.</p>

<p>I finally finished from Unilag, after 7 long tiring and tumultuous year journey, I finally collected my B.Pharm. I couldn‚Äôt explain what I felt more, relief or joy, but anyway, I am glad that phase is finally over. There were some other wins in between that I struggle to remember now, I won one essay competition winning a couple hundred dollars, won PSN-YPG hackathon too, can‚Äôt remember others again sha.
But if it was all rosy like this, then, why did I feel down, like an underachiever, like the year was a shitshow? Because life happened and it does not need to inform you beforehand nor take permission from you to, it just happens. I think the really first bitter pill for me to swallow was not finishing with distinction. This has been a long-time goal of mine and I fumbled it, well, I didn‚Äôt, life happened. I mean I started on a very great note in that school, I mean what better evidence does anyone need than when my friend, who graduated as the second-best graduating student in my class said I motivated her to give it a shot (Ennie, thank you very much for that kind word, it will always remain with me forever). It‚Äôs just quite ironic that, that me, ‚Äúthe motivator‚Äù didn‚Äôt end up with the distinction. I guess it tells more of the story of how we can motivate and inspire people to be the very best version of themselves, and go for some wins even if we don‚Äôt ever get to achieve it.</p>

<p>School was great actually until sometime between my third and fourth year in school when I had about 8 or 9 courses where I scored 69, yes 8/9 course, and yes 69. The sad part is nobody is going to look at the transcript and see that ‚ÄúOh!! He actually had 69 in all of them, he missed out by just one mark‚Äù. if you have just one of those, you‚Äôll be like ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs part of life‚Äù, if you have 2 or 3, you‚Äôll be like ‚Äúokayyyyy‚Äù, at the end of my stay in Unilag, I think I had 69 in about 11 courses (i think a couple were 59s too), yes, that is jaw-dropping and it was really just sad, but yunno what they say, life ultimately goes on. I had crazy anxiety attacks also during the year, at some point, the sound of my phone ringing was all my mind needed to go bananas, it was sad and debilitating that it affected my ability to work, to concentrate, to focus and finish projects I was already on, I had to make a couple of refunds also on project I had already taken on. I lost money too, there was someone I did a project for that ran away with my money, this is in hundreds of thousands of naira sha (Tom, if you‚Äôre reading this, please send me my money, let sapa not win this war against my life).</p>

<p>In addition to all those, getting interviews in top global companies is def a good signal that you‚Äôre on the right path, but at some point, converting those roles will be the better thing and so when I missed out on roles upon roles, you‚Äôll begin to wonder if there‚Äôs an agency at work, losing out on two roles in December, especially one where I  got to the final stage for an internship in UK was very painful as I had already lost my job at this point. At sometime, you‚Äôll start feeling like maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a fraud or just not good enough which I think is true. Not in the sense of self defeat but in recognition of the fact that I can be better and I should be, so yeah, maybe I am not good enough for where I am supposed to be.And yes, I lost my job around the ending of the year due to the recent economic donwturn for startups plus I was about resuming for my one year internship and was not sure how well I‚Äôll be able to handle both, so yeah, sad! sad!! sad!!!</p>

<p>However, I‚Äôm not going to absolve myself of all the responsibilities here, I guess 2023 taught me more about myself than I already knew. First, my communication sucks. I think it‚Äôs easy to communicate when everything is working perfectly, but it is harder but much more important to communicate when things get rough and here is where I missed it. Around the time I was battling with anxiety, so many things were happening simultaneously, but I thought I needed to sort everything out first and figure it all out by myself before communicating, I think it‚Äôs something I learnt from childhood having to look out for myself, nobody really cares about the excuses, they just want the problem solved. While true, it‚Äôs also perfectly fine to communicate the uncertainty, the challenges you‚Äôre facing, that you‚Äôre clueluess about how you‚Äôll solve it but you‚Äôll still give it your best shot, how you‚Äôre trying to navigate the problem and most importantly, that you need help. It‚Äôs totally fine to just communicate and that is a lesson I‚Äôll be taking with me for the rest of my life. I guess I have messed up some relationships and important networks, but like another of my favourite quote says ‚Äúna who disappoint you go still make you proud‚Äù, if given enough time and grace, I hope I can rebuild these relationships going forward.</p>

<p>Also, I discovered I have a long lag/acceleration time after some moment of deceleration and break. I think I first discovered this while studying in school, it takes me about 30 mins or an hour to get to the same level of concentration and focus if I took a break in between, it takes me a long while to start my day if I wake up late, I really just can‚Äôt go from 0 to 100 in 10secs, it takes a while. But the reality is we can‚Äôt go full speed 365 days a year, there are times we actually need to rest and calm, restrategise before giving it another go. I guess this is something I haven‚Äôt figured out yet but willing to figure out as the time continue.</p>

<p>I think one final thing I learnt is the tradeoff that exist to life, I went from believing there are limited opportunites for me in the world to seeing the boundless opportunities that exist, but the question I ask myself now is, how much effort do I put into each of these opportunites? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I give a shitload of effort trying to secure the bag and the opportunities but the question is, do I approach each one like it‚Äôs the only opportunity that exist for me in the world? Or do I put in just some decent effort and shrug it off with ‚Äúwell, that is just life‚Äù when I don‚Äôt win. Well, unlike some other things where you can either have this or that, not both, you (and I) can actually have both in this case, chase off every opportunity that you see for you and put in the best effort to each of them like it‚Äôs the only one you have. it doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôll get all of them, but you‚Äôll know you gave your best and that counts for something.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm very optimistic about 2024 and the abundant opportunities it has for me. It already smells like ease and endless possibility but one thing I‚Äôll be focusing on this year is developing the bias for action and leveraging the power of consistency. I think I can get caught up in that preparatory phase for so long that I‚Äôm almost exhausted before I start and I think it ties back to that second thing about my long lag/acceleration but my goal for this year is not to dey explain explain because I dey tire quickly, I want ‚Äúdoings‚Äù to want to choke me, like that reddit post, I want my brand to be that 10X engineer and with absolute no shade nor insult intended to content creators (I really mean it), I don‚Äôt think that for me, it is smiling behind the camera, saying ‚Äúwelcome back to my Youtube channel‚Äù, it‚Äôs by building stuff, moving fast and doing that consistently. That‚Äôs not to say I won‚Äôt be willing to share whatever it is I learn along the way, the baseline is expect less talking from me, you‚Äôll probably see less of me everywhere too, I guess it just have to be that way till yunno. Lastly, I hope to live a truly happy and free life, enjoying the mundane things of the moment, no matter how fucked up or insane the moment seems, I think that is the only true way to live because the next big thing no dey ever finish. I just want to live.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I really struggled to get this review under way, but it has turned out to be this 2000 words rant, I guess I‚Äôll just wrap it up here. So as we all can see, 2024 is already here and like I tell people, it‚Äôs Tabula rasa baby, because it‚Äôs really a new blank check and slate, it doesn‚Äôt matter how you tried and failed, made fun of yourself and underachieved last year, what matters now is what you do with the new start, new slate and new opportunity before you, alot can happen in 2024, if you‚Äôre willing to make it happen and as you continue in this new year, ‚ÄúI want you to be successful and to earn it, but realise that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself‚Äù. 
See you in 2024, and yes, please incase you guys have or you know anyone having an opening for a machine learning engineer or data scientist, please holla, I actually sabi and just lemme show, help a brother and not let hunger kill man this new year. A bientot.</p>
