    Original tweet by @madeofajala on twitter, dated:Dec 31, 2023, "I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.”
</div>

<p>Sometime in 2023, I shared a quote on X (previously Twitter). Here’s the interesting thing: it’s a quote from a book I have never read. But, like the quote itself suggests, it isn’t one that is supposed to be quoted from a book or whipped up on an inspirational basis, it is one that is best experienced.</p>

<p>The thing is, failure is not an easy topic to talk about. Nobody wants to be seen as a specialist in failure, and thus no one wants to claim authority in this regard. Neither do I. I believe my experience with failure pales in comparison to many people’s, but I have experienced my fair share, and despite how difficult it is to talk about it, there are still some important lessons we can all take away from failure.</p>

<p>I believe the most important lesson we learn from failure is “grace”. This is something we usually don’t recognize until we have experienced it ourselves. Here’s what I mean: Most of us have a simple, reductionist view of life—“If you fail, it’s because you didn’t read”,  “If you’re poor, it’s probably because you’re not hardworking enough”, “If you miss out on an important memory, it’s because you either didn’t value it or didn’t commit it to memory enough”. On the surface, these statements appear true, or at least they seem easier to accept when flipped: “If you don’t read, you will fail”. So, when someone fails, it’s assumed they didn’t do the former.</p>

<p>When I entered university, I had this very same mindset: “What do you mean you failed? You probably played away your time or didn’t value your education enough to put in the required effort”. “People celebrating being graded 50 in an exam? Eww!”. It also didn’t help that I was a high flyer. For exams graded over 100, I aimed for 80s and 90s and achieved them most times. I just couldn’t fathom why people would settle for less.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: most people with these beliefs genuinely believe them, because they simplify life, making it easier for them to interpret and navigate. However, the challenge with broad statements like these is that they don’t accommodate nuance—because nuance lives on the edge (where I have been mostly these days, pun intended). This isn’t to debunk or nullify the truth in those statements, because, truly truly (I say to you), as a student, if you don’t read or study, chances are you will probably fail, and that’s a high probability. This truth translates to many other things. However, failure teaches you that, while effort is crucial, sometimes and many times, there are many other factors can cause it and this does not include lack of effort.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until my third year in university that I truly understood this. I didn’t need to do anything extraordinary; I just had to prepare my reading schedule from the beginning of the semester and diligently read my books. But something changed. For some reason, I wasn’t getting the same results as I had before. To my simple mind, the only explanation was that I probably wasn’t putting in my best. In response, I decided to put in <strong>extraaaa</strong> effort. But here was the challenge: the more effort I put in, the more the results I greatly sought eluded me. Efforts that previously earned me 70s and 80s were now yielding 50s, 60s, and, at best, 69s that still got downgraded.</p>

<p>It was during this time that my eyes were opened to others around me who were in similar situations: putting in their best effort, trying hard and harder, some even harder than I did, but still not getting results. Some even had to retake exams. I learned compassion. I learned to give people grace, that just because something comes easily to you and not to others doesn’t mean they didn’t put in as much effort. As my Bible puts it: “The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all”.</p>

<p>Sometime last year, I broke up with my ex. A couple of weeks ago, during a chat with my friendship group, they were “whining” me about my serious girlfriend from before (haha, if you recognize those discussions). Someone said, “Next time, before you make a move like that, be sure you heard God properly” and I totally understood where he was coming from because his perspective came from the truest intentions. Prior to that experience, this would have been my default response to anyone in a similar situation. However, as they say, experience is the best teacher. I’ve now learned that so much happens on the edge, and life can’t always be interpreted with the simplest explanations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PS: My circle is a God-centric and believing one, as I am myself, so thoughts like these are not out of place.</p>

<p>In addition to grace, failure has taught me something else, something we really need to learn, even though it’s tough: the ability to fail even more😂. This is interesting because I started this essay by mentioning how no one likes to lose, including myself. But the interesting thing is that we need to learn how to lose, fail, and keep trying again. Last year, Roger Federer gave a commencement address at Dartmouth College (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWUuYTcG-o">link here</a>) that I found fascinating. He mentioned how he isn’t recognized as one of the greatest of all time in tennis by winning every match, game, or competition. Instead, it’s by his continued effort, time and time again. “For you to be great at anything, you need to get comfortable with losing”. So, how do you fail without failing? Or how do you get comfortable with failing without failing?</p>

<p>In my personal observation, those at the top of their careers often have the lowest win ratios at the start of their journeys. You need to take so many shots in the beginning, many of which you’ll miss, fail miserably at, or fall short of, but you have to learn how to fail and deal with failure while still pressing on. As I often say to my friends, “most people won’t care how many shots it took you to win, they’ll only care that you won”.</p>

<p>Maybe what I’m trying to say in many words is this: failure teaches resilience. It teaches you to keep moving in the face of adversity, even when it seems nothing is yielding results, not to give up or give in too early. The first time you fail, it will most definitely affect you deeply, perhaps to your core. It may cause you to doubt everything you’ve believed about yourself, your dignity, or even your personhood, especially if your sense of self is tied to your ability to achieve excellence. Getting comfortable with failure helps you detach from this mindset. Your sense of self and personhood is not tied to success or failure. A bad day is not a bad life. You just need to keep moving, striving, and making an effort. All you need is that one big break.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve exhausted the serious lessons we can learn from failure (not an exhaustive list, just the most important ones I can muster at this point), there’s one more lesson, albeit a funny but nonetheless important one: failure gives you interesting stories to tell. Think about it, some of your personal most captivating stories most definitely came from moments of adversity. Were they funny in real time? Definitely not. But in retrospect, they often are. And unless you want to be the boring uncle or aunt who never has a funny story to tell, this is another reason to optimize for failure. 😂 So fail more today and thank me tomorrow.</p>

<p>The summary is: not all failures are fatal and failure is never easy to deal with, no matter how many times you’ve failed. Some failures will still paralyze you and hold you in a chokehold. Yes, you’ll be disappointed. Yes, you’ll be pained. Yes, you may need to take time off to gather yourself. But what you can never do is stop trying. Till next time, shalom! ✌🏾✌🏾</p>

<p>If there’s something I’m very good at, it is delayed gratification or delayed happiness you can call it. I’m a firm believer that anything worthwhile takes time and so if you really want to be happy, you should be able to wait, to defer it till a later, as the Bible puts it, “till your joy is full”. So at every point, something appears like my biggest op (short for opposition).</p>

<p>Initially, my biggest op was my University, for a school with a high ceiling and the potential to be a lot more, choosing to be mediocre annoyed and frustrated me. I felt handicapped, I felt hoodwinked. While my colleagues abroad are learning how to apply artificial intelligence in drug discovery and, the latest advances in clinical pharmaceutical sciences, I felt forced and coerced into cramming shikimic pathway and writing word for word some things some lecturer dictated out in class (and that’s not because I think they some of those things are not important, I just felt emphasis was on the wrong things. BTW I do not think, cramming and writing verbatim is important for anybody or anything, atleast not in 2024 again).</p>

<p>Then my biggest op became the pharmacy profession based on how it was portrayed in Nigeria. I felt I needed to do something else outside the profession for me to be truly happy. Between the constant jabs and warfare with the healthcare sector between those who think the whole health sector is under their servitude and so they run the whole sector and others, to people within the profession that will rather exploit and underpay the young ones, the crazy work schedule and work hours, commitments, etc, it just doesn’t look like there’s a way this profession could buy me a Benz in the nearest future without running a retail/community pharmacy, which isn’t something that I’m really interested in per se, I honestly just want to do some awesome research, discover new therapies and make the world a better place (BTW, I do not attach any intrinsic value to Benz, it’s just a colloquial way of estimating wealth here in Nigeria).</p>

<p>Later on, my biggest op became Nigeria. See, Nigeria showed me in an active term what it means when they say “talents are global, opportunities are not”. Nigeria, in a pessimist’s words, “is the place dreams come to die”. Every day is a fight for survival, a fight for legitimacy and for your right to survive, to exist, to be and to thrive. One of the worst inflation in decades, weakening currency, high unemployment rate, rife crimerate, tribalism and national discord plus for some reason, it seems like the worst of us has managed to capture the state and state apparatus, so like you can imagine, it has been disaster upon disaster. Just like someone said on twitter, “it reached our turn to make dough (money), na so cost of living con start to dey rise”. While I love this country to bits and would love to see it work, function and rise to her name, I just feel like I need to first be out of here to truly be happy, and if you were in my shoes, you’d reckon I was making the best choice.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of all that, I’m constantly reminded of the words of NightBirde (the Britain Got Talent star) who despite having just a few months left to live due to cancer she had, came on to show and shared one of the most powerful quotes I’ve heard in a while “You can not wait until life isn’t hard anymore before you decide to be happy”, and that, ladies and gentlement, struck a cord in me. The idea that happiness is a destination that needs to be reached, that it’s some achievement, some milestone that needs to be ticked, I have come to learn is all an illusion that will always be eluded, because human wants and needs are insatiable and at the point in which we achieve those things, we want some other new thing and the circle continues. The other reason is life is an equal balance and mix of good days and bad days, like the preacher says, ‘A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace,and a time to refrain from embracing”. The summary is there’s going to be a time for all and one does not invalidate the other, however, just like the moon, we are not less human or less deserving of happiness on days we feel half-full or empty.</p>

<p>So just like the Christian Apostle, Paul, I want to say “I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have in abundance. I have learnt the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want” and through it all, I have chosen to be happy. And also because I believe we can share positivity round the world by us choosing to be happy. I believe by shining our light strongly, beautifully and unashamed of our scars, we encourage and empower others to do so also, we tell them they can choose to be happy, despite the shitty coins life might be shelling on them today, they deserve to be happy and choose to be happy.</p>

</div>

<p>So today, as I celebrate another year around the star in our Milky Way galazy (birthday), I am choosing to chase happiness and to be happy regardless of the circumstance, to seek happiness in the little and mundane things, to linger a bit more on that call with that friend that I have missed, to hold and hug a bit longer the friend I haven’t seen in forever, to chat and hang out a bit more with my friends while I can now, to buy those sneakers that I have always wanted, to dance in the rain while listening to my favourite childhood jam, not because happiness is found in things or people, because in the end, all we are left with the choice to either be happy or wallow in the pits of self pity and regrets and as for me, I’ll rather fill them with the little sprinkle of happiness that I can find and because that, I believe everyone deserves just to be a little bit happier and also because being happy is one of the best things I can also contribute to the world right, by sharing my joy that isn’t defined nor limited by the challenges and trials of this world but one that is evergreen and ethereal, I remind and encourage others to also.</p>

<p>Sometimes, counting our blessings is all we need to remind ourselves how far we have come, that everything is not all gloom, everything is not all bad and by all means, we are miles away from where we started, maybe not at the destination yet but we far ahead of the starting point, and ladies and gentlemen, that is progress.</p>

<p>2023 was a solid year for me, but it took me writing out this thread on Twitter sometime last week for me to come to terms with how great it was. Here is the thing, I started this year on a great note and with high expectations. Finally, I was doing my dream job as a machine learning engineer at a new but awesome startup building a very nice product. The best part of it? My role was core machine learning, machine learning engineering and ops, just enough dose of what I like and enjoy doing, life was good bruh!! I think the peak was me attending Lagos Tech Expo and seeing the excitement and awe on people’s faces using the product I’ve been building, it’s like that moment when a mother finally meets the baby she has been carrying for months, the joy is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>That same quarter, a paper I contributed to was accepted at ICLR, this was yunno a huge one for my budding research career also, a big shoutout to Chris Fourie, one of the nicest people I know at SisonkeBiotik and the entire team, hoping I can do more for the community this year. I bought myself a MacBook also. So here’s the backstory to that, as of last year December, if someone told me I was going to buy myself a Macbook I will say it was a lie, the only hope I had for winning a MacBook was via two giveaways (Enyata and Cardtonic, both who were doing giveaways at the time), interestingly, I got to the final stage for both but lost both, I was like, yunno what? I’m going to buy myself a Macbook and I did. Guess I was a bit liquid at the time (the next goal is “unbelievable liquid”, from my mouth to God’s ear).</p>

<p>I think the highlight was my interview for Meta’s AI residency program in March. This singular incident is the greatest motivation I have in my career that “if I’ve made it this far, then I can only go all the way”. I mean this was me, learning Stochastic Gradient Descent, GANs and Graph Neural Networks in the morning while cramming the shikimic pathway, Feline Diabetes and Pharmacodynamic parameters at night. Just 3 years ago, for more than 6 months, all I was able to learn was via Google Colab using my 1 gig RAM Itel phone that by the time you switch tabs, you have to wait 20 mins for the tab to load again. The most interesting part of it was that the interview was on Data Structures and Algorithms which I really didn’t have that much idea about prior and went on to kill the interview with just about 3 weeks of preparations. 
Sadly, Meta had to close the role just because of the macroeconomic challenges at the time (they had just laid off another set of people, I think). I went on to interview with some other top companies both locally and globally.</p>

<p>I finally finished from Unilag, after 7 long tiring and tumultuous year journey, I finally collected my B.Pharm. I couldn’t explain what I felt more, relief or joy, but anyway, I am glad that phase is finally over. There were some other wins in between that I struggle to remember now, I won one essay competition winning a couple hundred dollars, won PSN-YPG hackathon too, can’t remember others again sha.
But if it was all rosy like this, then, why did I feel down, like an underachiever, like the year was a shitshow? Because life happened and it does not need to inform you beforehand nor take permission from you to, it just happens. I think the really first bitter pill for me to swallow was not finishing with distinction. This has been a long-time goal of mine and I fumbled it, well, I didn’t, life happened. I mean I started on a very great note in that school, I mean what better evidence does anyone need than when my friend, who graduated as the second-best graduating student in my class said I motivated her to give it a shot (Ennie, thank you very much for that kind word, it will always remain with me forever). It’s just quite ironic that, that me, “the motivator” didn’t end up with the distinction. I guess it tells more of the story of how we can motivate and inspire people to be the very best version of themselves, and go for some wins even if we don’t ever get to achieve it.</p>

<p>School was great actually until sometime between my third and fourth year in school when I had about 8 or 9 courses where I scored 69, yes 8/9 course, and yes 69. The sad part is nobody is going to look at the transcript and see that “Oh!! He actually had 69 in all of them, he missed out by just one mark”. if you have just one of those, you’ll be like “well, it’s part of life”, if you have 2 or 3, you’ll be like “okayyyyy”, at the end of my stay in Unilag, I think I had 69 in about 11 courses (i think a couple were 59s too), yes, that is jaw-dropping and it was really just sad, but yunno what they say, life ultimately goes on. I had crazy anxiety attacks also during the year, at some point, the sound of my phone ringing was all my mind needed to go bananas, it was sad and debilitating that it affected my ability to work, to concentrate, to focus and finish projects I was already on, I had to make a couple of refunds also on project I had already taken on. I lost money too, there was someone I did a project for that ran away with my money, this is in hundreds of thousands of naira sha (Tom, if you’re reading this, please send me my money, let sapa not win this war against my life).</p>

<p>In addition to all those, getting interviews in top global companies is def a good signal that you’re on the right path, but at some point, converting those roles will be the better thing and so when I missed out on roles upon roles, you’ll begin to wonder if there’s an agency at work, losing out on two roles in December, especially one where I  got to the final stage for an internship in UK was very painful as I had already lost my job at this point. At sometime, you’ll start feeling like maybe it’s because you’re a fraud or just not good enough which I think is true. Not in the sense of self defeat but in recognition of the fact that I can be better and I should be, so yeah, maybe I am not good enough for where I am supposed to be.And yes, I lost my job around the ending of the year due to the recent economic donwturn for startups plus I was about resuming for my one year internship and was not sure how well I’ll be able to handle both, so yeah, sad! sad!! sad!!!</p>

<p>However, I’m not going to absolve myself of all the responsibilities here, I guess 2023 taught me more about myself than I already knew. First, my communication sucks. I think it’s easy to communicate when everything is working perfectly, but it is harder but much more important to communicate when things get rough and here is where I missed it. Around the time I was battling with anxiety, so many things were happening simultaneously, but I thought I needed to sort everything out first and figure it all out by myself before communicating, I think it’s something I learnt from childhood having to look out for myself, nobody really cares about the excuses, they just want the problem solved. While true, it’s also perfectly fine to communicate the uncertainty, the challenges you’re facing, that you’re clueluess about how you’ll solve it but you’ll still give it your best shot, how you’re trying to navigate the problem and most importantly, that you need help. It’s totally fine to just communicate and that is a lesson I’ll be taking with me for the rest of my life. I guess I have messed up some relationships and important networks, but like another of my favourite quote says “na who disappoint you go still make you proud”, if given enough time and grace, I hope I can rebuild these relationships going forward.</p>

<p>Also, I discovered I have a long lag/acceleration time after some moment of deceleration and break. I think I first discovered this while studying in school, it takes me about 30 mins or an hour to get to the same level of concentration and focus if I took a break in between, it takes me a long while to start my day if I wake up late, I really just can’t go from 0 to 100 in 10secs, it takes a while. But the reality is we can’t go full speed 365 days a year, there are times we actually need to rest and calm, restrategise before giving it another go. I guess this is something I haven’t figured out yet but willing to figure out as the time continue.</p>

<p>I think one final thing I learnt is the tradeoff that exist to life, I went from believing there are limited opportunites for me in the world to seeing the boundless opportunities that exist, but the question I ask myself now is, how much effort do I put into each of these opportunites? Don’t get me wrong, I give a shitload of effort trying to secure the bag and the opportunities but the question is, do I approach each one like it’s the only opportunity that exist for me in the world? Or do I put in just some decent effort and shrug it off with “well, that is just life” when I don’t win. Well, unlike some other things where you can either have this or that, not both, you (and I) can actually have both in this case, chase off every opportunity that you see for you and put in the best effort to each of them like it’s the only one you have. it doesn’t mean that you’ll get all of them, but you’ll know you gave your best and that counts for something.</p>

<p>I’m very optimistic about 2024 and the abundant opportunities it has for me. It already smells like ease and endless possibility but one thing I’ll be focusing on this year is developing the bias for action and leveraging the power of consistency. I think I can get caught up in that preparatory phase for so long that I’m almost exhausted before I start and I think it ties back to that second thing about my long lag/acceleration but my goal for this year is not to dey explain explain because I dey tire quickly, I want “doings” to want to choke me, like that reddit post, I want my brand to be that 10X engineer and with absolute no shade nor insult intended to content creators (I really mean it), I don’t think that for me, it is smiling behind the camera, saying “welcome back to my Youtube channel”, it’s by building stuff, moving fast and doing that consistently. That’s not to say I won’t be willing to share whatever it is I learn along the way, the baseline is expect less talking from me, you’ll probably see less of me everywhere too, I guess it just have to be that way till yunno. Lastly, I hope to live a truly happy and free life, enjoying the mundane things of the moment, no matter how fucked up or insane the moment seems, I think that is the only true way to live because the next big thing no dey ever finish. I just want to live.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I really struggled to get this review under way, but it has turned out to be this 2000 words rant, I guess I’ll just wrap it up here. So as we all can see, 2024 is already here and like I tell people, it’s Tabula rasa baby, because it’s really a new blank check and slate, it doesn’t matter how you tried and failed, made fun of yourself and underachieved last year, what matters now is what you do with the new start, new slate and new opportunity before you, alot can happen in 2024, if you’re willing to make it happen and as you continue in this new year, “I want you to be successful and to earn it, but realise that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself”. 
See you in 2024, and yes, please incase you guys have or you know anyone having an opening for a machine learning engineer or data scientist, please holla, I actually sabi and just lemme show, help a brother and not let hunger kill man this new year. A bientot.</p>
